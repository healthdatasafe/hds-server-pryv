// 
//   If the project contains a file called '.api-version' at its root, 
//   the contents of the file are returned as version string. 
//   Take care to strip newlines from the file. 
// 
// The way we find the project root is as follows: Look at the paths in 
// 'process.mainModule' - and try to find the first one which does exist. This
// is where we load our modules from ('node_modules') and we'll expect the 
// .api-version file to be a sibling. 
// 
// Example: 
// 
//  const pv = new ProjectVersion();
//  pv.version(); // => 1.2.3
// 
class ProjectVersion {
  // Returns the projects version number.
